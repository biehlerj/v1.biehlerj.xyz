While working for [Moebius Solutions](https://www.moesol.com/) I got my [CompTIA Security+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security)
certificate in order to certify my skills in cybersecurity.

You can find my Security+ certification on [Credly](https://www.credly.com/badges/75df1eb7-93d1-4950-b1b1-b5d6731ca730/linked_in_profile).
