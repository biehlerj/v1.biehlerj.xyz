# Personal website written with Next.js

## No longer maintained

This was the first version of my portfolio website written using Nextjs. I eventually switched from Nextjs to Hugo and am now doing a complete rewrite of my website using Nextjs and Tailwind using the [Catppuccin Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/catppuccin/tailwindcss) library. The new version can be found [here](https://github.com/biehlerj/biehlerj.github.io).
