For instance on Linux if you had <code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code>\ndefined the config.toml file for Cointop would be placed into <code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.config/cointop/</code> rather than\n<code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cointop/</code>.</p>\n<p>You can find the code and subsequent tests that were added in <a href=\"https://github.com/cointop-sh/cointop/pull/58\">this PR on GitHub</a></p>\n<p>Skills used:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Go</li>\n</ul>\n","title":"Cointop","date":"2020-08-10"}},"__N_SSG":true}
